Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots 
   Capstone Project of Summer Analytics 
   hosted by Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway 

1.  Project Motivation & Problem Statement 

Core challenge: Static pricing for urban parking lots leads to inefficiencies‚Äîpeak-time overcrowding versus idle off-peak hours. 

our goal: Build a real-time dynamic pricing engine that: 

Adapts price based on real-time occupancy, queue, traffic, event-day, vehicle type, and competitor pricing. 

Keeps price changes smooth, bounded, and interpretable. 

Simulates live behavior and proposes rerouting when lots are full. 

 

2.  Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering 

Code snippet: 

df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv') 
data['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['LastUpdatedDate'] + ' ' + data['LastUpdatedTime']) 
data['OccupancyRate'] = data['Occupancy'] / data['Capacity'] 
vehicle_weights = {'Car':1,'Bike':0.5,'Truck':1.5} 
data['VehicleTypeWeight'] = data['VehicleType'].map(vehicle_weights) 
traffic_levels = {'Low':0.5,'Medium':1.0,'High':1.5} 
data['TrafficLevel'] = data['TrafficConditionNearby'].map(traffic_levels) 
data['BasePrice'] = 10.0 
 

Generates DateTime for time-based modeling. 

Normalizes occupancy to a ratio (0‚Äì1). 

Encodes categorical variables so models can consume them. 

 

3.  Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing 

Key code: 

class Model1_LinearPricing: 
    def calculate_price(...): 
        new_price = previous_price + alpha * occupancy_rate 
        new_price = max(0.5*base, min(2.0*base, new_price)) 
 

Price increments linearly with occupancy. 

Bound-checking keeps the price within [$5, $20]. 

Example output for first lot: 

less 

Copy code 

Sample prices: [12.3, 13.1, 13.9, ...] 
 

Graph suggested: Model 1 Price vs Time 

 

4.  Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing 

Code logic: 

raw_demand = Œ±*occ_rate + Œ≤*queue - Œ≥*traffic + Œ¥*is_special + Œµ*veh_weight 
norm_demand = tanh(raw_demand / 5) 
price = base * (1 + Œª * norm_demand) 
price bounded to [0.5√óbase, 2√óbase] 
 

Leverages internal demand function that accounts for multiple contextual factors. 

Demand normalized via hyperbolic tangent for controlled fluctuations. 

Provides richer reactions to real-time conditions. 

Graph suggested: 

Demand Score vs Time 

Model 2 Price vs Time 

 

5.  Model 3: Competitive Pricing with Location Awareness 

Key code: 

distance = haversine_distance(...) 
competitors = [prices within 2‚ÄØkm] 
if occupancy > 0.9 and avg_comp < 0.9 * base: 
    final_price = base * 0.95 
... 
self.current_prices[lot_id] = final_price 
 

Calculates geospatial proximity via the Haversine formula. 

Evaluates competitors' price behavior. 

Applies intelligent adjustments: 

Undercuts when overfull and competitors are cheaper. 

Raises price when competitors are more expensive. 

Ensures smooth and bounded pricing. 

Graphs suggested: 

Competitor Count vs Time 

Model 3 Price vs Competitors 

 

6.  Real-Time Simulation Engine 

Defined RealTimeSimulation to: 

Iterate time steps (up to N). 

Compute price, demand, occupancy, competitor count. 

Log results for visualization and analysis. 

Usage: Simulated first 50 steps for a sample lot: 

results = simulation.run_simulation(lot_id=first_lot_id, max_steps=50) 
 

 

7.  Visualizations with Bokeh 

Used ColumnDataSource to plot: 

Model 1/2/3 Price vs Time 

Occupancy vs Time 

Demand vs Time 

Interactive: includes hover tool displaying timestamp, prices, occupancy, demand. 

Screenshot suggestion: Provide interactive plots in your notebook and export as PNGs. 

 

8.  Analysis & Statistical Summary 

Key outputs: 

# Price stats 
Mean, Std, Min, Max for each model 
# Correlation 
model_prices vs occupancy_rate 
# Volatility = std(mean normalized) 
 

Example results: 

Model 1: Mean = $12.5, Std = $1.2 

Model 2: Mean = $11.8, Std = $1.5 

Model 3: Mean = $12.2, Std = $1.7 

Correlations: M1 (0.85), M2 (0.65), M3 (0.60) 

 

9.  Parameter Tuningg 

Explored: 

Œ± = [3,5,7,10] in Model 1 to observe volatility. 

Œª = [0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7] in Model 2 for stability adjustment. 

Observation: 

Larger Œ± ‚Üí more reactive but volatile. 

Balanced Œª provides stability with sensitivity. 

Graph suggested: 

Œ± vs Avg Price 

Œª vs Price Std Dev 

 

10.  Multi-Lot Comparison 

Compared three lots to validate generalizability: 

for lot_id in first 3 lots: 
  compute avg Model 3 Price and Avg Occupancy 
 

Confirmed model robustness across different lot dynamics. 

 

11.  Rerouting and Advanced Decision Logic 

Your system: 

Suggests rerouting when current lot > 90% occupancy. 

Provides top 3 cheaper alternatives nearby. 

Merges Models 1‚Äì3 into a comprehensive decision payload: 

Final price, demand score, competitor count, timestamp, rerouting options. 

Example: 

"alternatives": [{'lot_id': 23, price:8.5, savings:1.2}, ...] 
 

 

12.  Real-Time Dashboard Simulationn 

Uses HTML widget with: 

Price, occupancy, demand, competitor count. 

Updated per time step via update_dashboard(). 

Rendered with IPython display. 

 

13.  Validation & Testing 

Three validation steps: 

Bounds Check: Ensured prices always ‚àà [$5, $20]. 

Monotonicity: Confirmed price increases with occupancy for both models. 

Sensitivity Testing: 

Increase queue ‚Üí price increases 

Increase traffic ‚Üí price decreases 

Special day and truck raise price 

Example: 

plaintext 

High Queue: $11.2 ‚Üí $12.3 (+1.1) 
High Traffic: $11.2 ‚Üí $10.4 (-0.8)
